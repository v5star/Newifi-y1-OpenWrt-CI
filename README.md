# Actions-OpenWrt

我Fork别人的，正在测试中，自己定制自己用到的插件，有想自己弄的，可以一起研究。

Build OpenWrt using GitHub Actions

成功后再来写教程，补坑。

## Usage

- Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/P3TERX/Actions-OpenWrt/generate) button to create a new repository.
- Generate `.config` files using [Lean's OpenWrt](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) source code. ( You can change it through environment variables in the workflow file. )
- Push `.config` file to the GitHub repository.
- Select `Build OpenWrt` on the Actions page.
- Click the `Run workflow` button.
- When the build is complete, click the `Artifacts` button in the upper right corner of the Actions page to download the binaries.

## Tips

- It may take a long time to create a `.config` file and build the OpenWrt firmware. Thus, before create repository to build your own firmware, you may check out if others have already built it which meet your needs by simply [search `Actions-Openwrt` in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Actions-openwrt).
- Add some meta info of your built firmware (such as firmware architecture and installed packages) to your repository introduction, this will save others' time.
